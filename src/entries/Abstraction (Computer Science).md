## Abstraction (Computer Science)

Something that is abstract exists as a thought or idea but does not have a physical or concrete existence. 

Abstraction, as it applies to programming, is the act of hiding implementation details to focus on details of greater importance; a simple example could be a function that draws a circle of a specified radius and color to the screen, the *implementation details* are the function definition, and the *details of greater importance*, in this case, is the function call.

One of the four pillars of [Object Oriented Programming](/wiki/Object%20Oriented%20Programming) is Abstraction.
